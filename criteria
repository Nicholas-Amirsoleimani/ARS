Grade: 93

## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Fine.

## main help page:

Clear. Good set of examples.

## quality of user interface:

Good set of args with defaults, but bounds are required even if whole real line.

## performance on my tests:

Generally good.
Fails with narrow normal density not centered at 0.
Fails with double exponential.

## t density output:

Errors without indicating non log-concavity.

## presence of tests:

Tests pass. In general tests shouldn't make plots.
5 warnings.

Various unit tests, though many simply check the output type/length.
Good variety of K-S tests.

## code efficiency:

0.2 sec for 5000 samples.

## comments in code:

Good in general. Would be helpful to have comments explaining logic of
some of the more complicated parts, such as how the initial abscissae
are determined.

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

I like the sampling of multiple values at once, but setting k=1000 is a lot, particularly early on in the algorithm so there is some wasted computation there.

Strategy for initial abscissae looks good, though it didn't work for my narrow normal density test case.

There's a lot of code. Should be possible to make it more concise.

## equality of workload:

It looks like Nick did rather more of the work.

## writeup:

Clear. I would have liked to see more examples, but they are present in the testing.
